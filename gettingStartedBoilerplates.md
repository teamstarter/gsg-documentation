Each boilerplate is a simple To Do list React app based on [this codepen](https://codepen.io/karlomajer/pen/rvyyvV) that allows you to manage tasks (create, update, delete, count).

Follow the instructions in the readme files to use them:

- In JavaScript: [GSG Boilerplate](https://github.com/teamstarter/gsg-boilerplate)
- In TypeScript: [GSG Boilerplate TypeScript](https://github.com/teamstarter/gsg-boilerplate-typescript)
